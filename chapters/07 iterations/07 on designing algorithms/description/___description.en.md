At this point in the book, you will often run into exercises and coding
problems for which you are unsure how to solve them. I gave an example
of such a problem above (finding of ten numbers the largest, the
smallest, and the number divisible by 3), and the solution I came to.
Such a solution approach is called an "algorithm." But how do you design
such algorithms?

I often see students typing code without really knowing what they are
doing. They are trying to solve a problem but do not know how, so they
start typing. You may realize that this is not a good approach to
creating solutions (even though experimenting a bit might help).

What you have to do in such a situation is sit back, leave the keyboard
alone, and think "How would I solve this problem as a human?" Try to
write down what you would do if you would do it by hand. It does not
matter if what you would do is a very boring task that you would never
want to do by hand â€“ you have a computer to do the boring things for
you.

Once you have figured out what you would do, then try to think about how
you would translate that to code. Because basically, that is what you
need to tell the computer: the steps that you as a human would take to
get to a solution. If you really cannot think of any way that you as a
human would use to solve a problem, then you sure as hell won't be able
to tell the computer how to do it for you.
